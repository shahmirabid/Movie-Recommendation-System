This project involves retrieving and merging data from two CSV files, `movies.csv` and `credits.csv`, which contain movie information and credits, respectively. After processing the data and extracting relevant features, a Data Frame is created to store movie titles and associated tags. Utilizing text vectorization techniques like Count Vectorizer, the project converts textual data into numerical vectors and calculates cosine similarity between movies based on their tags. This enables the recommendation of similar movies to users based on their input. Additionally, the project integrates the TMDB API to fetch movie posters for the recommended movies, enhancing the user experience.
